      <h2>My Role</h2>
      <p>
        As part of the <strong>Object-Oriented Programming</strong> course during the <strong>second year of
          university</strong>, I was tasked with developing a Java application called <strong>CineReviews</strong>. This
        project simulates an online review system where users can register as critics, audience members, or admins, and
        review movies and series. I was responsible for the <span class="underline">core logic</span>, <span
          class="underline">object-oriented design</span>, and <span class="underline">command-line interface</span>.

      <h2>Challenges & Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        The main challenge was implementing the complex rules of user roles, show management, and review aggregation.
        Additionally, managing the dynamic nature of user interactions, show uploads, and artist information required
        careful planning.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> I used object-oriented programming principles to create classes for users, shows,
          artists, and reviews, ensuring modularity and reusability.</li>
        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> I implemented a command-line interface to handle user input and output, following
          the exact specifications provided in the project brief.</li>
        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> I conducted thorough testing to ensure that all edge cases, such as duplicate
          reviews and show uploads, were handled correctly.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Results & Impact</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Functional Application:</strong> The final product was a fully functional Java program that could
          simulate an online review system, complete with all the rules and mechanics described in the project brief.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Positive Feedback:</strong> The project was well-received by the course instructors, who praised the
          clarity of the code and the robustness of the simulation logic.</li>
        <li><strong>Learning Experience:</strong> This project significantly improved my understanding of
          object-oriented design, Java programming, and problem-solving in a data management context.</li>
