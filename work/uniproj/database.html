      <h2>My Role</h2>
      <p>
        As part of the <strong>Databases</strong> course during the <strong>second year of university</strong>, I was
        tasked with developing a complete database system using Oracle® 18c and Oracle® Application Express (APEX) for
        the interface. This project involved designing a database schema, implementing it, and creating a user-friendly
        interface to interact with the data. I was responsible for the <span class="underline">database design</span>,
        <span class="underline">schema implementation</span>, and <span class="underline">APEX interface
          development</span>.
      </p>

      <h2>Challenges & Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        The main challenge was designing a robust database schema that could handle complex relationships and ensure
        data integrity. Additionally, creating an intuitive and functional APEX interface required careful planning and
        iterative development.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> I used Oracle® 18c to implement the database schema, ensuring proper
          normalization and integrity constraints.</li>
        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> I developed an APEX interface to allow users to interact with the database,
          including forms, reports, and navigation features.</li>
        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> I conducted thorough testing to ensure that all functionalities, such as data
          insertion, updates, and complex queries, worked as expected.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Results & Impact</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Functional Database System:</strong> The final product was a fully functional database system with a
          user-friendly interface, complete with all the features described in the project brief.</li>
        <li><strong>Positive Feedback:</strong> The project was well-received by the course instructors, who praised the
          clarity of the database design and the robustness of the APEX interface.</li>
        <li><strong>Learning Experience:</strong> This project significantly improved my understanding of database
          design, SQL, and web-based interface development using APEX.</li>
