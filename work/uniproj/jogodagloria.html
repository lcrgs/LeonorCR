      <h2>My Role</h2>
      <p>
        As part of the "Introdução à Programação" course during the <strong>first semester of my first year at
          university</strong>, I was tasked with developing a simplified version of the
        "Torneio da Glória" in Java. This project involved simulating a tournament where players compete in a series of
        games, with the goal of being the last player standing. I was responsible for the <span class="underline">game
          logic</span>, <span class="underline">player management</span>, and <span class="underline">board
          mechanics</span>.
      </p>

      <h2>Challenges & Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        The main challenge was implementing the complex rules of the game, including special squares like "multas,"
        "precipícios," and "pássaros," which affect player movement and penalties. Additionally, managing the tournament
        structure and ensuring fair player elimination required careful planning.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> I broke down the problem into smaller components, such as player movement,
          penalty application, and game state management, and tackled each one systematically.</li>
        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> I used object-oriented programming principles to create classes for players, the
          game board, and the tournament, ensuring modularity and reusability.</li>
        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> I implemented thorough testing to ensure that all edge cases, such as player
          elimination and special square effects, were handled correctly.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Results & Impact</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Functional Game:</strong> The final product was a fully functional Java program that could simulate
          the "Torneio da Glória" with up to 10 players, complete with all the rules and mechanics described in the
          project brief.</li>
        <li><strong>Positive Feedback:</strong> The project was well-received by the course instructors, who praised the
          clarity of the code and the robustness of the game logic.</li>
        <li><strong>Learning Experience:</strong> This project significantly improved my understanding of Java,
          object-oriented design, and problem-solving in a programming context.</li>
      </ul>
