      <h2>My Role</h2>
      <p>
        As part of the <strong>Object-Oriented Programming</strong> course during the <strong>second year of
          university</strong>, I was tasked with developing a Java application called <strong>Gossip!</strong>. This
        project simulates the spread of gossip within a community, tracking who knows what about whom. The application
        allows users to create people, landmarks, and groups, and simulate the sharing of gossip under specific rules. I
        was responsible for the <span class="underline">core logic</span>, <span class="underline">object-oriented
          design</span>, and <span class="underline">command-line interface</span>.

      <h2>Challenges & Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        The main challenge was implementing the complex rules of gossip spreading, including different types of people
        (forgetful, gossipers, and sealed lips) and their unique behaviors. Additionally, managing the dynamic nature of
        groups within landmarks and ensuring accurate gossip tracking required careful planning.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> I used object-oriented programming principles to create classes for people,
          landmarks, groups, and gossips, ensuring modularity and reusability.</li>
        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> I implemented a command-line interface to handle user input and output, following
          the exact specifications provided in the project brief.</li>
        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> I conducted thorough testing to ensure that all edge cases, such as gossip
          sharing and group dynamics, were handled correctly.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Results & Impact</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Functional Application:</strong> The final product was a fully functional Java program that could
          simulate the spread of gossip in a community, complete with all the rules and mechanics described in the
          project brief.</li>
        <li><strong>Positive Feedback:</strong> The project was well-received by the course instructors, who praised the
          clarity of the code and the robustness of the simulation logic.</li>
        <li><strong>Learning Experience:</strong> This project significantly improved my understanding of
          object-oriented design, Java programming, and problem-solving in a simulation context.</li>
      </ul>
