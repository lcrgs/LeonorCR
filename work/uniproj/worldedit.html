      <h2>My Role</h2>
      <p>
        As part of the <strong>Software Engineering</strong> course, I was part of a team tasked with extending the
        <strong>WorldEdit</strong> platform, a popular Minecraft mod. Our mission was to reverse engineer the existing
        codebase, identify design patterns and code smells, and implement new functionalities. I was responsible for
        <span class="underline">reverse engineering</span>, <span class="underline">design pattern
          identification</span>, and <span class="underline">implementing one of the user stories</span>.
      </p>

      <h2>Challenges & Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        The main challenge was understanding the existing codebase of WorldEdit, which is a large and complex Java
        project. We had to identify design patterns, analyze code metrics, and refactor code smells while ensuring that
        new functionalities were seamlessly integrated. Additionally, we followed a Scrum-inspired approach to manage
        the project, which required careful coordination and communication within the team.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> We used tools like <strong>MetricsTree</strong> and <strong>IntelliJ
            IDEA</strong> to analyze the codebase and identify patterns and smells.</li>
        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> We implemented new functionalities by following Agile principles, with weekly
          sprints and regular code reviews.</li>
        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> We documented our findings and progress in detailed reports, including use case
          diagrams, class diagrams, and sequence diagrams.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Results & Impact</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Functional Extensions:</strong> We successfully implemented three new user stories, enhancing the
          WorldEdit platform with new functionalities.</li>
        <li><strong>Improved Codebase:</strong> We identified and refactored several code smells, improving the
          maintainability of the codebase.</li>
        <li><strong>Learning Experience:</strong> This project significantly improved my understanding of software
          engineering principles, Agile methodologies, and reverse engineering.</li>
      </ul>
