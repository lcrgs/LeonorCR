      <h2>My Role</h2>
      <p>
        As part of the <strong>Languages and Programming Environments</strong> course during the <strong>second year of
          university</strong>, I was tasked with developing an interpreter for a stack-based virtual machine in OCaml.
        This project simulates the execution of bytecode instructions, similar to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). I was
        responsible for the <span class="underline">core logic</span>, <span class="underline">instruction set
          implementation</span>, and <span class="underline">execution flow</span>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Challenges & Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        The main challenge was implementing the stack-based execution model, including handling instructions like
        <code>PUSH</code>, <code>POP</code>, <code>ADD</code>, and <code>JMP</code>. Additionally, managing the dynamic
        nature of stack operations and ensuring correct control flow required careful planning.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> I used OCaml's functional programming features to create a clean and modular
          design for the interpreter, ensuring clarity and maintainability.</li>
        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> I implemented a stack data structure to manage the execution state and handle
          instructions efficiently.</li>
        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> I conducted thorough testing to ensure that all edge cases, such as invalid
          instructions and stack underflows, were handled correctly.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Results & Impact</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Functional Interpreter:</strong> The final product was a fully functional OCaml program that could
          interpret and execute stack-based bytecode instructions, complete with all the rules and mechanics described
          in the project brief.</li>
        <li><strong>Positive Feedback:</strong> The project was well-received by the course instructors, who praised the
          clarity of the code and the robustness of the execution logic.</li>
        <li><strong>Learning Experience:</strong> This project significantly improved my understanding of virtual
          machines, stack-based execution, and functional programming in OCaml.</li>
      </ul>
