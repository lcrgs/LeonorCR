      <h2>My Role</h2>
      <p>
        As part of the <strong>Algorithms and Data Structures</strong> course during the <strong>second year of
          university</strong>, I was tasked with developing a Java application called <strong>ArtAuctions</strong>. This
        project simulates an online auction system where users can register as collectors or artists, add artworks, and
        participate in auctions. I was responsible for the <span class="underline">core logic</span>, <span
          class="underline">data structure design</span>, and <span class="underline">command-line interface</span>.
      </p>

      <h2>Challenges & Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        The main challenge was implementing the complex rules of user roles, artwork management, and auction dynamics.
        Additionally, managing the dynamic nature of user interactions, artwork uploads, and auction bidding required
        careful planning.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> I used object-oriented programming principles to create classes for users,
          artworks, auctions, and bids, ensuring modularity and reusability.</li>
        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> I implemented a command-line interface to handle user input and output, following
          the exact specifications provided in the project brief.</li>
        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> I conducted thorough testing to ensure that all edge cases, such as duplicate
          bids and auction closures, were handled correctly.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Results & Impact</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Functional Application:</strong> The final product was a fully functional Java program that could
          simulate an online auction system, complete with all the rules and mechanics described in the project brief.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Positive Feedback:</strong> The project was well-received by the course instructors, who praised the
          clarity of the code and the robustness of the simulation logic.</li>
        <li><strong>Learning Experience:</strong> This project significantly improved my understanding of algorithms,
          data structures, and problem-solving in a simulation context.</li>
      </ul>
