      <h2>My Role</h2>
      <p>
        As part of the <strong>Redes de Computadores</strong> course, I was tasked with developing an HTTP Proxy Server
        with optional caching functionality. This project involved implementing a sequential and concurrent proxy
        server, handling GET requests, and optionally adding caching to improve performance. I was responsible for the
        <span class="underline">proxy server implementation</span>, <span class="underline">caching mechanism</span>,
        and <span class="underline">testing</span>.

      <h2>Challenges & Strategy</h2>
      <p>
        The main challenge was understanding the HTTP protocol and implementing a proxy server that could intercept,
        modify, and forward requests. Additionally, adding caching functionality required careful handling of disk I/O
        and ensuring that cached responses were valid. The concurrent version of the proxy server introduced the
        complexity of handling multiple client requests simultaneously.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> I implemented the proxy server in Python, using the <strong>socket</strong>
          library to handle network communication.</li>
        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> For the concurrent version, I used Python's <strong>threading</strong> module to
          handle multiple client requests simultaneously.</li>
        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> I implemented a simple caching mechanism that stores responses on disk and
          retrieves them for subsequent requests.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Results & Impact</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Functional Proxy Server:</strong> The final product was a fully functional HTTP proxy server that
          could handle GET requests and optionally cache responses.</li>
        <li><strong>Improved Performance:</strong> The caching mechanism significantly reduced response times for
          repeated requests.</li>
        <li><strong>Learning Experience:</strong> This project significantly improved my understanding of networking,
          the HTTP protocol, and concurrent programming.</li>
